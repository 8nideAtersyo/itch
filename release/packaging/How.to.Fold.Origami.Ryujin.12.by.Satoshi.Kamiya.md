# How to Fold Origami Ryujin 1.2 by Satoshi Kamiya
 
Origami Ryujin 1.2 is a complex and realistic model of a dragon designed by Satoshi Kamiya, a famous origami artist from Japan. It is one of the most challenging origami models ever created, requiring hundreds of hours of folding and shaping. In this article, we will show you how to fold Origami Ryujin 1.2 using the official diagram by Satoshi Kamiya.

## What You Need
 
To fold Origami Ryujin 1.2, you will need the following materials:
 
- A large sheet of paper, preferably foil-backed or tissue-foil paper. The size of the paper should be at least 100 cm x 100 cm (40 inches x 40 inches) for a decent result. The color of the paper should be dark on one side and light on the other side, to create contrast between the scales and the body of the dragon.
- A bone folder or a similar tool to crease the paper sharply and accurately.
- A ruler and a pencil to mark the grid on the paper.
- A pair of scissors to cut off excess paper.
- A lot of patience and perseverance.

## Step 1: Pre-creasing
 
The first step to fold Origami Ryujin 1.2 is to pre-crease the paper according to the diagram by Satoshi Kamiya. The diagram can be found in his book *Works of Satoshi Kamiya 1995-2003*, or online as a PDF file[^1^]. The pre-creasing involves dividing the paper into a grid of 128 x 128 squares, and then making diagonal, horizontal, and vertical creases on each square. This will create a crease pattern that will guide you in collapsing the paper into a base shape.
 
To pre-crease the paper, follow these steps:

1. Mark a grid of 128 x 128 squares on the paper using a ruler and a pencil. You can use any method you prefer, such as folding and unfolding, or measuring and marking. Make sure the grid is accurate and even.
2. Crease all the diagonal lines on each square by folding and unfolding the paper along them. You should have two diagonal creases on each square, forming an X shape.
3. Crease all the horizontal and vertical lines on each square by folding and unfolding the paper along them. You should have four horizontal and vertical creases on each square, forming a plus shape.
4. Cut off any excess paper around the grid using scissors.

You should now have a paper with a complete crease pattern for Origami Ryujin 1.2. This is what it looks like:

## Step 2: Collapsing
 
The next step to fold Origami Ryujin 1.2 is to collapse the paper into a base shape using the crease pattern. The base shape is a three-dimensional structure that contains all the main features of the dragon, such as the head, the body, the legs, the wings, and the tail. The collapsing process involves folding and unfolding along existing creases, as well as making new creases to form pleats and flaps.
 
To collapse the paper into a base shape, follow these steps:

1. Start from one corner of the paper and fold along one of the diagonal creases that forms an X shape on a square. This will create a flap that extends from that corner.
2. Repeat step 1 for all four corners of the paper, creating four flaps that extend from each corner.
3. Flip over the paper and fold along one of the horizontal or vertical creases that forms a plus shape on a square. This will create another flap that extends from that edge.
4. Repeat step 3 for all four edges of the paper, creating four more flaps that extend from each edge.
5. Flip over the paper again and fold along one of the diagonal creases that forms an X shape on a square that is adjacent to one of the corner 0f148eb4a0
