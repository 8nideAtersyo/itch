Softube Saturation Knob is a modeled output distortion plugin that can be used anywhere you need some grit. It has one big knob that controls the amount of saturation, and a switch that lets you choose between three different modes: Keep High, Neutral, and Keep Low. These modes affect the frequency response of the distortion, allowing you to tailor it to your source material.
  
Keep High mode preserves the high frequencies and distorts the low end more, making it suitable for brightening up vocals, guitars, or synths. Neutral mode applies a balanced distortion across the spectrum, giving a natural and transparent sound. Keep Low mode keeps the low frequencies intact and adds harmonics to the highs, making it ideal for fattening up bass, drums, or keys.
